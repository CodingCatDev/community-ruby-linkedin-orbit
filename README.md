## First Time Setup

To set up this integration you will need to follow some steps required by LinkedIn. Please follow the [First Time Setup guide](docs/FIRST_TIME_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## Application Credentials

The application requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | More Info

| `LINKEDIN_CODE` | LinkedIn Browser Refresh Code | [LinkedIn Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow)
| `LINKEDIN_ORGANIZATION` | LinkedIn Organization Page ID | Format: `urn:li:organization:#{id}`. ID is the set of numbers in LinkedIn page URL, i.e. `https://www.linkedin.com/company/28866695`, the ID is `28866695`.
| `ORBIT_API_KEY` | API key for Orbit | Found in `Account Settings` in your Orbit workspace
| `ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID` | ID for your Orbit workspace | Last part of the Orbit workspace URL, i.e. `https://app.orbit.love/my-workspace`, the ID is `my-workspace`

## Package Usage

To install this integration in a standalone app, add the gem to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "linkedin_orbit"
```

Then, run `bundle install` from your terminal.

You can instantiate a client by either passing in the required credentials during instantiation or by providing them in your `.env` file.

### Instantiation with credentials:

```ruby
client = LinkedinOrbit::Client.new(
    orbit_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY,
    orbit_workspace_id: YOUR_ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID,
    linkedin_code: YOUR_LINKEDIN_BROWSER_REFRESH_CODE,
    linkedin_organization: YOUR_LINKEDIN_ORGANIZATION_ID
)
```

### Instantiation with credentials in dotenv file:

```ruby
client = LinkedinOrbit::Client.new
```

### Fetching LinkedIn Comments

Once, you have an instantiated client, you can fetch LinkedIn comments on your organization's posts and send them to Orbit by invoking the `#comments` instance method:

```ruby
client.comments
```
## CLI Usage

You can also use this package with the included CLI. To use the CLI pass in the required environment variables on the command line before invoking the CLI:

```bash
$ ORBIT_API_KEY=... ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID=... LINKEDIN_CODE=... LINKEDIN_ORGANIZATION=... bundle exec linkedin_orbit --check_comments
```
